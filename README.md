Aperture Tile-Based Visual Analytics
==============

Aperture Tiles provides the ability to create browser-based, interactive tools any analyst can use to explore data sets containing billions of data points (or more).

Business and government leaders, operators and analysts today have more data than ever at hand to make smart, informed decisions. This information comes from various places, including social media, sensor data, financial transactions, cyber and open-source data. However making sense of such massive amounts of data is an extremely challenging task. As a result data is often not used to its full potential.

Aperture Tiles uses a pyramid of tiles to structure, analyze, visualize and interact with a user interface similar to web-based geographic map applications. This approach allows analysts to easily see and navigate all of the data without losing detail, and seamlessly "zoom in" to a more localized portion of that data.

Tailored analytic overlays (e.g., alerts, pattern detection, feature extraction) can be applied to the data at every scale, ranging from the entire dataset to a very small portion of it. Seeing all of the data reveals informative patterns and provides important context to understanding insights identified by computational analytics.

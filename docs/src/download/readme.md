Please note that Aperture Tiles is dependent on the *master* branch of Aperture JS, an agile, extensible visualization framework library project. Like Aperture Tiles, the Aperture JS source code is under ongoing development and is freely available for download under the The MIT License. The Aperture JS source code is available on GitHub.

For information on full installations of Aperture Tiles (along with Aperture JS), see the [Installation](../docs/development/installation/) page.

## Packaged Distribution ##

The following pre-built distribution can be used to quickly generate and display tiles without having to build the software. See the [Quick Start](../docs/development/quickstart) documentation to help you quickly learn how to process a data set, transform it and create an Aperture Tiles project that allows you to visualize it in a web browser.

- <a name="tile-generator"></a>**Tile Generator**: Enables you to generate a set of tiles that can be viewed using the template Tile Client available below. This version was built for Apache Spark 1.0 and CDH 4.6.

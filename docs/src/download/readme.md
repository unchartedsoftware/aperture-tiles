For information on full installations of Aperture Tiles (along with Aperture JS), see the [Installation](../docs/development/installation/) page.

## Packaged Distribution ##

The following pre-built distribution can be used to quickly generate and display tiles without having to build the software. See the [Quick Start](../docs/development/quickstart) documentation to help you quickly learn how to process a data set, transform it and create an Aperture Tiles project that allows you to visualize it in a web browser.

- <a name="tile-generator"></a>**Tile Generator**: Enables you to generate a set of tiles that can be viewed using the template Tile Client available below. This version was built for Apache Spark 1.0 and CDH 4.6.

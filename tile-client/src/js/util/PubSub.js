/**
    A hierarchical publish and subscribe namespace. Channels consist of strings, sub-channels
    are separated with a period ('.'). Publishing to a target channel will propagate the message
    breadth first as follows:
        1) from the root of the hierarchy to the target channel,
        2) from the target channel to all existing sub-channels

    Ex.

        Hierarchy:

            a -> [ a.a, a.ab ] -> [ a.a.a, a.a.b, a.a.c ]

        Publishing to a.a will publish:

            1) from root to target

                [ a -> a.a )

            2) from target to all sub-channels

                [ a.a -> a.a.a -> a.a.b -> a.a.c )

        Publishing to a.a.c will publish:

            1) from root to target

                [ a -> a.a -> a.a.c )

            2) from target to all sub-channels

                [ a.a.c -> null )
